### "I, Robot" at university
This year I attended the practical course Lego Mindstorm Robot at my university. Together with 3 friends we constructed our robot Sir Daniel and participated the big challenge.

At the right you can see what our robot looked like.

### Sir Daniel's abilities
We programmed Sir Daniel with lejos, Java for Lego Mindstorms.
It was able to detect and follow a line, cross a bridge, find the exit of a maze and solve a color riddle.

### The challenge
Though Sir Daniel did not win the challenge he was the first robot (far ahead!) to reach the last section: a battle with the endboss (constructed by our advisors).
