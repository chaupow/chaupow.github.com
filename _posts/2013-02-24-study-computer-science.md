Here you can find some videos from me and my friends, talking about studying computer science in general and studying computer science at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). These are all in german.

This presentation was at "Uni f√ºr Einsteiger" the university's open day for high schoolers in November 2012. The presentation was given together with [Tobias Sturm](http://www.tobiassturm.de/).

This video was recorded at the celebration of "40 Years Department of Informatics" in October 2012.
You see me and Martin Dinh. Please excuse my first 3 min of talking, as I was apparently quite excited and therefore I was talking *really* fast.
